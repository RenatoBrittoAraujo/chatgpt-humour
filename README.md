Prompting ChatGPT for humorous things. The objective is to be funny.

## ChatGPT weights-in on the book "Republic" by Plato



```
Socratease: Tell me, Glaucoma, have you ever considered the nature of justice?

Glaucoma: Indeed, Socratease, but only as far as my eye can see.

Socratease: And what have you seen?

Glaucoma: That justice is giving each their due. Like when I borrowed a chariot from Euphorbus, I had to return it. It was only just.

Socratease: A profound observation, indeed. But consider this: what if you borrowed a lyre from a madman?

Glaucoma: I suppose I would play a tune or two.

Socratease: But would you return the lyre to the madman if he might harm himself with it?

Glaucoma: Certainly not! It would be unjust to return an instrument to one who would play it poorly.

Socratease: Aha! So you agree that justice is not always returning what one has borrowed?

Glaucoma: Indeed, Socratease. Justice must also consider the quality of music.

Socratease: Now, let us turn to the idea of the ideal state. What do you think it should be like?

Glaucoma: Well, surely there should be ample parking for chariots, and the streets free of litter.

Socratease: Indeed, a clean and orderly state is a happy state. But what of its rulers?

Glaucoma: They should be the wisest, of course. Perhaps those who know where to find the best olives.

Socratease: A wise criterion indeed! For what is wisdom without olives?

Glaucoma: Nothing but dry words, Socratease.

Socratease: And what of the poets and playwrights?

Glaucoma: Banish them! Their fanciful tales make my head spin more than a night of Dionysian revelry.

Socratease: But without poets, where would we find our bad examples?

Glaucoma: You speak truly, Socratease. We must keep them, if only to know what not to do.

Socratease: So, we have built an ideal state with good parking, excellent olives, wise rulers, and poets for bad examples. A utopia, indeed!

Glaucoma: A perfect republic, Socratease, as clear to me as the day I lost my spectacles.

## ChatGPT mocks the linux manual

```
User: man program1

Terminal:

vbnet

NAME
    program1 - Does something incredibly specific

SYNOPSIS
    program1 [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
    program1 is designed to perform a task. The nature of this task is not
    entirely clear, and the outcomes are somewhat unpredictable. It's highly
    recommended but not required.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Display this help message and exit. You'll need it.

    -v, --verbose
        Explain what's happening, but in a way that's no clearer than the actual
        command.

    -q, --quiet
        Do it silently. Because sometimes, you don't want anyone to know what
        you're up to.

EXAMPLES
    To run program1, just type 'program1'. We can't tell you what will happen,
    but it's worth a try.

SEE ALSO
    program2(1), mysterycommand(1)

User: man program2

Terminal:

css

NAME
    program2 - Probably complements program1

SYNOPSIS
    program2 [OPTION]... [SOURCE]... [DESTINATION]...

DESCRIPTION
    Invokes an operation that is essential but only vaguely related to what
    program1 does. It's recommended to use it after program1, before lunchtime,
    or during a full moon.

OPTIONS
    -y, --yes
        Assume 'yes' to all questions, because who has time for prompts?

    -n, --no
        Assume 'no' to all questions. Opposite of '-y', because we need balance
        in life.

    -c, --confuse
        Output in an ancient, forgotten dialect for added complexity.

EXAMPLES
    To combine with program1, use 'program2 -after program1'. Don't ask what
    '-after' does. It's classified.

SEE ALSO
    program1(1), anothermystery(1)
```

### prompt 
```
mock the writing style of linux command line terminal manual (man <command>). make it as ironic as you can. emphasize how much it sometimes like concrete usage instructions. pretend as if the user has just typed 'man <program1>' then 'man <program2>'. note how spartan and direct the communication style is.
